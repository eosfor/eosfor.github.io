      <description>Well, in their documentation MSFT says that: To enable HTTPS, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to use Azure CDN because Azure Storage does not yet natively support HTTPS with custom domains
However, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a quick trick to make it possible. Well, actually, they also did it :). But I decided to make this post anyway.
So in general, there is a proxy functionality on top of Azure Functions. This allows us to put a proxy in front of a storage account and redirect all calls to a function to the storage account static website URL.</description>

Here is a bit about the experience I got with it, having in mind I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked with these tools before. Here I&amp;rsquo;m trying to look at this from the Infrastructure perspective, but not from the developers&amp;rsquo; perspective.
Containers, Cloud and private environments Few things to keep in mind for AKS Well first of all, lets see what we&amp;rsquo;ve got.</description>
