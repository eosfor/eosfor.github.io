Hello colleagues, at last I managed to configure [Github pages](https://pages.github.com), and I'm going to use it as a new hosing platform for thi blog. What i can also say - it was not easy at all :). I used [WLS-based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and a great template for Jekyll - [Jekyll-uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno). In addition to that i was able to build integrate [Syntaxhighlighter](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter) into Jekyll. Now it more or less works.

Frankly, not sure if i'm going to write a lot of posts here. I tried to start "blogging" a lot of times, but each time was not successful, unfortunately. Will see what going to happen this time!
