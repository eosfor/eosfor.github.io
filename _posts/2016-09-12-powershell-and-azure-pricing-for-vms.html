<p><a href="https://github.com/eosfor/AzureCalc">Here </a>is the quick and dirty way to calculate prices for Azure. By now it is possible to quickly ask and compare prices on core and ram basis. Also it is possible to run more precise queries on all parameters. It is really far from ideal but may help I hope.</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>
