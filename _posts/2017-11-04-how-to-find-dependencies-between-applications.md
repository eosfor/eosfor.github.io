<p>Hello colleagues. As part of migrations to the cloud most common question is - how to map existing application landscape? How to find all relations of the application being moved? How to see which systems it communicates to?</p>
<p>Actually I already blogged about this some time ago but this time example is a bit more clear. We need to do the following steps to graph our environment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable and collect Windows Firewall logsÂ  for all systems in the environment</li>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSQuickGraph/1.1">PSQuickGraph</a></li>
<li>Analyze the logs</li>
</ol>
<p>For the second step here is the simplest <a href="https://gist.github.com/eosfor/a29f53052c7bdfc98339e630149cccdb">example</a></p>
<p>And here is what we can get out of it.</p>
