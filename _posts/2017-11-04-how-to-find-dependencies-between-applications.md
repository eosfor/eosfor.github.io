Hello colleagues. As part of migrations to the cloud most common question is - how to map existing application landscape? How to find all relations of the application being moved? How to see which systems it communicates to?</p>
Actually I already blogged about this some time ago but this time example is a bit more clear. We need to do the following steps to graph our environment:

- Enable and collect Windows Firewall logsÂ  for all systems in the environment</li>
- Download and install [PSQuickGraph](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSQuickGraph/1.1)
- Analyze the logs


For the second step here is the simplest example

And here is what we can get out of it.
