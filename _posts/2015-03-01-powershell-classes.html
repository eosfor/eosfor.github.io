<p>What to say, <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn820211(v=wps.640).aspx">here </a>we have support for classes in PS. I cant say i'm happy. It looks over-complicated for simple scripting language. On other hand i was looking for this some time back what i had to make some enums for PS module. So, will see what this going to give us.</p>
