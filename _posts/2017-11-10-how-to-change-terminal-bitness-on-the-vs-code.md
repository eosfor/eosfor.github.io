I suddenly realized that VS Code start 32bit PowerShell host as a terminal. For some cases it does not work well so I decided to try to change it to run 64bit process instead. Here is how it can be done:

On the step 1 you need to change SysWOW64 to System32, and then restart the terminal by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+P and typing reload.

After that you just useÂ [System.Environment]::Is64BitProcess snippet to check if everything is ok.
